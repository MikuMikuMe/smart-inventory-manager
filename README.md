# Smart-Inventory-Manager

Creating a comprehensive Python program for a project like "Smart-Inventory-Manager" involves several aspects including inventory tracking, demand forecasting, order management, and possibly integrating with external systems for orders. Given the scope, let's focus on a simplified version that covers these bases with placeholder functions for more advanced processes like demand forecasting and external integrations.

Below is a high-level implementation with detailed comments and basic error handling:

```python
import logging
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s')

class InventoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty dictionary to store stock information
        self.inventory = {}  # Format: {item_id: {'name': name, 'stock': stock, 'threshold': threshold}}

    def add_item(self, item_id, name, initial_stock, threshold):
        """Add a new item to the inventory."""
        if item_id in self.inventory:
            logging.warning(f"Item with ID {item_id} already exists. Use update_item to modify it.")
        else:
            self.inventory[item_id] = {'name': name, 'stock': initial_stock, 'threshold': threshold}
            logging.info(f"Item {name} added with initial stock {initial_stock} and reorder threshold {threshold}.")

    def update_item(self, item_id, stock=None, threshold=None):
        """Update an item's stock and threshold values."""
        try:
            item = self.inventory[item_id]
            original_stock = item['stock']
            original_threshold = item['threshold']
            if stock is not None:
                item['stock'] = stock
            if threshold is not None:
                item['threshold'] = threshold
            logging.info(f"Item {item['name']} updated: Stock from {original_stock} to {item['stock']}, Threshold from {original_threshold} to {item['threshold']}.")
        except KeyError:
            logging.error(f"Item with ID {item_id} not found in inventory.")

    def check_reorder(self):
        """Check which items need to be reordered."""
        reorder_list = [item_id for item_id, details in self.inventory.items() if details['stock'] <= details['threshold']]
        if reorder_list:
            logging.info("Items to reorder:")
            for item_id in reorder_list:
                item = self.inventory[item_id]
                logging.info(f"{item['name']} (ID: {item_id}): current stock {item['stock']}, threshold {item['threshold']}")
        else:
            logging.info("All items are sufficiently stocked.")

    def demand_forecast(self, item_id):
        """Placeholder for demand forecasting - replace with real forecasting algorithm."""
        try:
            predicted_demand = random.randint(5, 20)  # Randomly generated number for demonstration
            logging.info(f"Predicted upcoming demand for {self.inventory[item_id]['name']}: {predicted_demand}")
            return predicted_demand
        except KeyError:
            logging.error(f"Item with ID {item_id} not found for demand forecasting.")
            return None

    def automated_order_process(self, item_id):
        """Automate the ordering process based on predicted demand."""
        try:
            item = self.inventory[item_id]
            predicted_demand = self.demand_forecast(item_id)
            if predicted_demand is not None:
                order_quantity = max(predicted_demand - item['stock'], 0)
                if order_quantity > 0:
                    logging.info(f"Placing order for {order_quantity} units of {item['name']}.")
                    # Placeholder for order placement logic
                else:
                    logging.info(f"No need to order more of {item['name']} at this time.")
        except KeyError:
            logging.error(f"Item with ID {item_id} not found in inventory.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    inv_manager = InventoryManager()
    inv_manager.add_item('001', "Widget A", 10, 5)
    inv_manager.add_item('002', "Widget B", 15, 7)

    inv_manager.update_item('001', stock=3)
    inv_manager.update_item('002', threshold=10)

    inv_manager.check_reorder()

    inv_manager.automated_order_process('001')
    inv_manager.automated_order_process('003')  # Should trigger error handling

```

### Explanation:

1. **Logging:** Uses Python's `logging` module instead of print statements for a more robust and configurable output.

2. **Inventory Management:** Basic methods to add and update inventory items, with logging for status messages and error handling with `KeyError` exceptions.

3. **Reordering:** A method to check for items that need reordering based on their stock levels and threshold.

4. **Demand Forecasting and Order Automation:** Placeholder functions that simulate demand forecasting (here, just generating random numbers for demonstration) and process orders based on forecasted demand.

5. **Error Handling:** Uses try-except blocks to catch potential issues like attempting to access or update non-existent items.

This program is a starting point. In a real-world implementation, you would replace placeholders with real data analysis and forecasting logic, likely utilizing data science libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`. Additionally, integration with actual order processing systems (e.g., via APIs) would be necessary.
